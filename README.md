## Overview

After learning basics of React, I decided to test my skills by creating this page. I made sure it's responsive and accessible.

## My process

I started by creating a template file that will store all of the necessary data that I want to display. Then, I created an HTML structure, added CSS and responsiveness.
After that, I checked accessibility (colors, contrast, alt tags, HTML document structure, headings), and created a CSS for print.

### Built with
